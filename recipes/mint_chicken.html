    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
        </li>
        <li>
            1 clove garlic, crushed
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup all-purpose flour
        </li>
        
        <li>
            ½ cup margarine
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
        </li>
        
        <li>
            ½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough. 
        </li>
    </ol>
